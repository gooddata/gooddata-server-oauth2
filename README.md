# GoodData Server OAuth2 Starter

The _GoodData Server OAuth2 Starter_ is an extension to [Spring Security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security)
library that adds support for storing OAuth2 related session data to HTTP only cookies.

Library is forked from [https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security)
to be able to reuse some internal classes and logic and stripped down to the minimum that is needed for the implementation.
